      "1. Peak in Primary Market Issuances: There is a belief that significant frontloading of issuances for essential refinancing could mean that primary market issuances may have already peaked in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. China's Deleveraging Campaign: The Chinese government's deleveraging policies could serve as a potential headwind. Chinese companies have contributed significantly to global bond issuances, and increased regulatory risk in certain sectors such as property, technology, tuition, food delivery, and commodities highlight the increased regulatory risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Uptick in Mergers and Acquisitions: M&A activities are expected to serve as a key driver for issuances across investment grade and high-yield bonds. With many companies having covered much of their refinancing needs in 2021, corporate priorities may begin to shift towards long-term growth, business diversification and supply chain strengthening strategies. Sectors such as technology, media and telecommunications (“TMT”) and healthcare are expected to lead in terms of deal activity and potential issuances.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Growth of the GSSSL Market: As countries and organisations pledge to make their economy carbon-neutral, various sustainable capital instruments have sprung up to aid this transition. The four main bond instruments used by organisations are Green, Social, Sustainability, and Sustainability-linked (“GSSSL”) bonds. For the GSSSL market, 2021 was an exceptional year as total issuances surpassed USD1 trillion, with both nations and companies tapping the sustainable debt capital markets to fund their investments. However, GSSSL bonds only represented approximately 4.5% to 5% of total global bond issuances in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Limited Demand and Liquidity: High yield bonds are not as actively followed by institutional investors as high-grade bonds, leading to smaller issuance sizes. In the secondary market, liquidity for high yield bonds can be inconsistent, especially in highly stressed liquidity scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Equity-like Returns: The riskier parts of the high yield space may offer sizable capital gains, bringing total returns closer to those typically seen in equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Information Asymmetry: The market for high yield bonds is less efficient than the market for higher-grade bonds, leading to information asymmetry. A solid bottom-up understanding of an issuer is important, including whether an issuer has access to alternative funding sources and the valuation of their assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Limited Options in Rising Interest Rates: In a rising interest rate environment, high yield bonds would be an ideal investment as they are less sensitive to interest rate rises. However, the SGD market is not deep and liquid enough for such a portfolio. Unlike the more mature US high yield market, there are no reliable default rate indicators in the SGD space.\n"

      "Bond indices are essential tools for tracking the performance of specific segments of the bond market. They are often used as benchmarks for Bond Index Funds (BIFs), which are portfolios of bonds that aim to match the performance of a particular bond index. Some of the most common bond indices track the U.S. investment-grade bond market and the Asiadollar credit market.\n",

      "However, passive investing in bonds through index replication may not always be the best strategy. This is primarily due to several reasons. Firstly, bond indices are typically weighted by the amount of debt outstanding by the various issuers. This means that the most indebted issuers represent the largest proportion of the index, which can lead to a heavy weighting towards these issuers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, due to the high number of constituents, bond indices can be challenging to replicate accurately, leading to a higher tracking error. Thirdly, the relatively illiquid nature of bonds can pose challenges for replication. Lastly, the trading cost of bonds is relatively high, which can impact returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these challenges, BIFs can still be a useful investment option for certain investors. They provide exposure to a wide selection of bonds with different maturities, credit ratings, and issuers, offering diversification benefits. They also typically have lower fees than actively managed bond funds and require less frequent trading, making them a cost-effective investment option.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, like all investment options, BIFs come with risks and limitations. Investors should carefully consider these factors before investing in BIFs. Active investing may be more suitable for bonds due to the reasons mentioned above.\n"
